            "education": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions). Objects are instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of the objects. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and extensibility in software development.",

            "education": "Inheritance is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes. The derived class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from the base class (superclass) and can also have its own unique attributes and methods.",
