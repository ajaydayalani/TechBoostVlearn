            "education": "A set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Sets are fundamental in mathematics and have applications in various fields. In set theory, the objects in a set are called elements. Sets can be represented using curly braces { } and listing the elements separated by commas. For example, the set of even numbers less than 10 can be written as {2, 4, 6, 8}.",

            "education": "In set theory, the complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. The universal set is the set of all possible elements under consideration. The complement of a set A is denoted by A'. For example, if the universal set is the set of integers and A is the set of even numbers, then A' would be the set of odd numbers.",
