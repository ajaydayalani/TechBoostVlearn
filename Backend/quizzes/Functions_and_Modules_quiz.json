            "education": "In programming, functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take input, perform computations, and return output. Functions help in organizing code, making it reusable and easier to understand. Modules, on the other hand, are files that contain Python code. They can define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python files by importing the module. Modules help in organizing code into separate files for better maintainability and reusability.",

            "education": "When working with modules in Python, you can import them using the 'import' keyword followed by the module name. This allows you to access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module. By importing modules, you can reuse code across different Python files and projects, making your code more modular and maintainable.",
