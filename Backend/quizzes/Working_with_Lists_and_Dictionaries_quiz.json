Dictionaries, on the other hand, are unordered collections of key-value pairs. In Python, lists are defined using square brackets [] and dictionaries using curly braces {}. Lists are indexed starting from 0, while dictionaries are accessed using keys. Understanding how to work with lists and dictionaries is essential for efficient data manipulation and storage.",
