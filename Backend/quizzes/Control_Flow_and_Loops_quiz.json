            "education": "Control flow refers to the order in which the program's code is executed. It allows the program to make decisions based on conditions and execute specific blocks of code accordingly. Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. There are different types of loops such as for loops, while loops, and do-while loops.",

It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement statement. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true. This type of loop is commonly used when the number of iterations is known.",
